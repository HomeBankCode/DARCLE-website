<h2>New investigators</h2>
<p>We are an international group of students and post-docs using the LENA System or other daylong (audio, video) recordings in their research.  On our our monthly conference calls, we discuss recent relevant literature and provide each other with feedback and support. We also liaise with the larger DARCLE community and discuss how their work might relate to our own.  The DARCLE New Investigator group is a growing community.  We welcome new members and ideas about how this group can engage novice researchers using the daylong recordings and the LENA System. To learn more about what our members are working on, please visit their sites. <u><b>To join, please contact Meg Cychosz</b> at <a href="mailto:mcychosz@berkeley.edu">mcychosz[at] berkeley.edu</a></u>.</p>

	<li><b>Meg Cychosz</b>, MA, M1 is a third year graduate student in linguistics at University of California, Berkeley. Before her doctoral work, Meg studied at the Phonetics Institute at Universite Sorbonne Nouvelle-Paris 3. She specializes in acoustic and articulatory phonetics, such as ultrasound biofeedback, in children and adult second language learners. Her dissertation will focus on the role of polysynthetic languages for children's phonetic development in bilingual environments. Contact Meg <a href="mailto:mcychosz@berkeley.edu">here</a> or visit <a href="http://mcychosz.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">her website</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Joseph Coffey</b> is a third year doctoral student in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. His research focuses on the influence of culture and socioeconomic  status on child-directed speech, and its relationship to children's language development. His current work examines the impact of maternal speech on the language outcomes of children adopted internationally.</li>
	<li><b>Elaine Smolen</b>, MAT, LSLS Cert. AVEd, is a PhD candidate and National Leadership Consortium in Sensory Disabilities scholar in deaf and hard of hearing education at Teachers College, Columbia University.  She serves as an adjunct faculty member at Teachers College and The College of New Jersey.  Her research focuses on the effects of caregivers' language input on the language and literacy development of children with hearing loss who use listening and spoken language.  She is particularly interested in implications for intervention with historically underserved children and families.  A certified Listening and Spoken Language Specialist, she has served young children with hearing loss and their families as a head classroom teacher and in an itinerant role. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-smolen-666a4a126/" target="_blank">Elaine's LinkedIn profile</a>.</li> 
	<li><b>Sarah Allen</b>, MA, is a specialist Speech and Language Therapist with deaf children. Having explored the acceptability of LENA to parents of young deaf children in the UK for her Masters dissertation at the University of Nottingham, she went on to study LENA's usefulness with these families at the National Institute for Health Research Hearing Biomedical Research Unit. She now works as Research & Public Engagement Lead at The Ear Foundation in Nottingham, UK. Her current research with the National Deaf Children's Society involves LENA in a study of pre-school deaf children using FM systems.</li>
	<li><b>Hanna Elo</b>, MA, is an SLP and a doctoral candidate at the School of Social Sciences and Humanities at the University of Tampere, Finland. Her dissertation study investigates the associations of neonatal health and early social environment with the language development of twins, but she is broadly interested in the enhancing and enabling effects of the everyday social environment to typically developing children and to children and adults with speech, language and hearing deficits.</li>
	<li><b>Hillary Ganek</b>, MA, CCC-SLP, LSLS Cert. AVT, completed her doctoral degree at the University of Toronto in 2017. Prior to beginning her research degree, Hillary worked clinically as an auditory-verbal therapist in Australia and in the cochlear implant clinic at Johns Hopkins. Her research focuses on the role of language socialization practices in intervention for families of children with hearing loss in low- and middle-income countries. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hillary-ganek-190598124/" target="_blank">Hillary's LinkedIn profile</a></li>
	<li><b>Jennifer Markfeld</b> is a fourth year undergraduate student in the Communication Sciences and Disorders program at James Madison University. Her research interests include infant-caregiver interactions, phonological development, and socioeconomic status. She is planning to attend graduate school for speech-language pathology in the Fall of 2019.</li>
	<li><b>Janet Y. Bang</b>, PhD, is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Psychology at Stanford University. She received her PhD in Communication Sciences and Disorders from McGill University, with a specialization in Language Acquisition. Her research investigates how children from typical and atypical populations learn language from the language and social input in their environment.  Her current work examines how early language environments of English- and Spanish-speaking children support their long-term learning.</li>
	<li><b>AJ Orena</b> is a third-year doctoral student at the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University. His research interests concerns the effects of language experience on speech and speaker processing. He is currently working on projects that explore word segmentation abilities in bilingual infants and talker identification abilities in adults.</li>
	<li><b>Gina M. Pretzer</b>, MS, CCC-SLP, is a third-year doctoral student at the University of California, Merced. She also works with the Merced County Office of Education assessing infants' cognitive and communication skills and providing families with strategies to support language development at home. Her research interests include infant vocal development and infant-caregiver interactions. She is also interested in early identification and treatment of communication disorders in infants and young children, as well as collaborative intervention techniques.  <a href="http://www.ginapretzer.com" target="_blank">Website</a></li>
	<li><b>Rachel R. Romeo</b>, MSc, CF-SLP is a doctoral candidate in the program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology, jointly administered by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She is broadly interested in how early childhood environments affect the neural basis of linguistic and cognitive development. For her dissertation, she is researching the structural and function neural correlates of individual differences in parental language input across families of varying socioeconomic statuses. <a href="http://gablab.mit.edu/index.php/gablab/people/14-sample-data-articles/212" target="_blank">Rachel's lab's website</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelrromeo/" target="blank">Rachel's LinkedIn profile</a></li>
	<li><b>Haille Heid</b>, is a graduate student in Speech & Hearing Sciences at Washington State University.  She is looking into speech production in children with hearing loss in the <a href="https://labs.wsu.edu/vandam/" target="_blank">Speech & Language Lab</a>.  She is expecting to complete her clinical work to be a speech-language pathologist in 2018.</li>
	<li><b>Sarah Surrain</b>, EdM, is a second-year doctoral student at Harvard University.  She studies the early language and literacy development of children from diverse linguistic backgrounds.  She is particularly interested in how language environments at home and at school influence oral language development during early childhood. Previously, she was a curriculum developer and literacy coach in Spanish-English bilingual classrooms in Chicago and taught Spanish as a foreign language in PK-12 settings. <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/sarahsurrain/" target="_blank">Sarah's scholar page at Harvard</a></li>
	<li><b>Catherine Laing</b>, PhD, is a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University. She is working on projects analyzing infants' transition from babble to speech, drawing from both longitudinal home-recorded data in the <a href="http://homebank.talkbank.org/access/Password/Bergelson.html" target="_blank">Seedlings corpus</a> and experimental evidence from eye-tracking. She has recently taken an interest in the way that an infant's domestic situation (number of siblings, caregiver work schedules) affects language acquisition in the first two years. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/catherineelaing" target="_blank">Personal website</a>.
